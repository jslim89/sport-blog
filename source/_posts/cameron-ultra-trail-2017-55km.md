Few months back, I was thinking whether to sign up for [TMMT](http://www.asiatrailmaster.com/the-magnificent-merapoh-trail/) or Cultra. The reason for TMMT is because of the 70KM category _(I wanted to try longer than 50KM, but shorter than 100KM)_, ended up I decided to sign up Cultra. I was attracted by the nice scenary.

### Jul 21, 2017 _(Friday)_

This time also the same, I drove up to Cameron alone, and meet up my friend there. Initially I worried I'm not able to reach the race kit collection place before it closed, so I passed all the documents to my friend.

But when I reached there, is about 5pm _(closed at 6pm)_. So I quickly get the documents from him and collect myself.

Can see long queue in the registration counter.

When I reached the mandatory items checking counter, I noticed I lost my blinker, then I quickly borrow 1 from my friend and pass through the checking.

Reminder for you, keep all the mandatory items inside zip-compartment.

### Jul 22, 2017 _(Saturday)_

I woke up at 3am _(the race started at 5am)_, and eat [Bak kut teh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bak_kut_teh) as breakfast ðŸ˜‚ . One of the team member prepare this, and is my first time to eat Bak kut teh before the race. Very nice experience.

And start at 5am sharp!!

#### Race

I heard some of my friends said, we must run fast at the beginning, because in the trail is at the beginning, and will _jam_ like hell. Then I run with a normal speed, and still stuck in the _traffic jam_...

![Reached CP1](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4317/35284412354_a25a684489_z.jpg)

When I reached CP1, the distance was **7.39KM**, and the time was **1hr 12min**. I just refill water and continue to move

![Reached CP2](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4318/35284411994_d080265ace_z.jpg)

When I reached CP2, the distance was **10.94KM**, and the time was **2hr 13min**. Around 1 hour for 3KM distance, can see how the traffic was. By the time already 7am+, already bright.

![CP2 coffee & tea](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4323/35284411854_eb212945e8_z.jpg)

Same, I drink some soft-drink, refill water and continue to move on.

![Reached CP3](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4327/35284410934_871747cc68_z.jpg)

This CP also take longer time, **16.49KM**, and the time was **4hr 03min**. Because was in trail... Again, I did the same thing, drink soft-drink, refill, go toilet and move on...

Now onwards, the path become easier
